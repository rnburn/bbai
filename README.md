**peak-engines** is machine learning framework that focuses on applying advanced optimization algorithms
to build better models. Here are some examples of what it can do:

### Ridge Regression Parameter Optimization
By expressing cross-validation as an optimization objective and computing derivatives, 
**peak-engines** is able to efficiently find regularization parameters that lead to the best
score on a leave-one-out or generalized cross-validation. It, futhermore, scales to handle 
multiple regularizers.

### Warped Linear Regression
Let *X* and *y* denote the feature matrix and target vector of a regression dataset. Under the
assumption of normally distributed errors, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) finds the linear model
that maximizes the likelihood of the dataset

</p>

What happens when errors aren't normally distributed? Well, the model will be misspecified and 
there's no reason to think its likelihood predictions will be accurate. This is where 
Warped Linear Regression can help. It introduces an extra step to OLS where it transforms the 
target vector using a flexible monotonic function *f* parameterized by *Ïˆ* and finds parameters that
maximize the likelihood of the transformed dataset

</p>

By introducing the additional transformation step, Warped Linear Regression is more general-purpose
than OLS while still retaining the strong structure and interpretability.
