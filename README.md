# peak-engines
peak-engines is a Python package for building Warped Linear Regression models. Warped 
Linear Regression is like Ordinary Least Squares but with an extra transformation step where
target values are remapped to latent values using a parameterized monotonic function. The
transformation makes Warped Linear Regression more general purpose than Ordinary Least Squares and able
to model datasets with non-normal error distributions.

## Installation
